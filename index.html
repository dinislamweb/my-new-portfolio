          <h3>What is Web Development?</h3>
          <p>Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.
        
        From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS); all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by web developers.
                        
        Web development can be broken down into three layers: client-side coding (frontend), server-side coding (backend) and database technology.
                        
        Let’s take a look at each of these layers in more detail.</p>
